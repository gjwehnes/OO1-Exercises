Within the SimplePerson class, create three public instance variables:
- A boolean variable active, with a default value of true
- A String variable called name with a default value of "Nemo"
- An integer variable called grade with a default value of 11

**Note**: you are not creating accessors for this exercise; rather you exposing your instance variables, so that other objects can directly read and/or modify them. This is perfectly legal, and in some cases perfectly sensible.
