The Bicycle class is meant to represent the current state of a bike, with respect to the gears and the brakes.

Thus, the class should have four instance variables (also sometimes known as members), one each for the forward gear, the rear gear,
the front brake, and the rear brake. Note that these instance variables should all be set as private, which means that they are not visible (in scope) to any other class, including the unit test included for this exercise. In other words, these variables are encapsulated.

The class requires a constructor, which takes in initial values for each of the four instance variables, in the order given above.
The class also requires public accessors and mutators for each of the instance variables.

Remember,
- If the unit test does not compile, ensure that you've written the mutators correctly. Remember that case matters!
- If the unit test compiles but fails on running, then check that you are getting / setting the correct values!
