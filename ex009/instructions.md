Complete the Car.java class:

Include the following instance variables:
- make (type String)
- model (type String)
- numberOfDoors (type int)
- topSpeed (type int)
- price (type int)

Write four constructors:
- A constructor that receives parameters for all instance variables
- A constructor that does not receive a parameter for numberOfDoors, which should default to 4
- A constructor that does not receives parameters for make or model, which both default to "unknown"
- A constructor that does not receives parameters for topSpeed or price, which default to 90 and 0 respectively.
