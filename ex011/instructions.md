### Ex011 StringFormatter
Let's take a break from classes, members, and methods... The String format method is a very useful way to build strings quickly.

-Complete four methods that each return a formatted String as specified in the unit test
  - As we've discussed before, the unit test quite often acts as the _specification_ (i.e. the instructions)
  - The intent of the methods should be clear from their naming and from the test cases

#### Note 
- Java's `String.format` method is quite similar to Python's `.format` function
- Both are similar (and in fact derive from) how string formatting was done in C and C++.
