Complete the Person class with the following:

### Instance Variables
- String firstName
- String lastName
- int birthMonth
- int birthDay
- int birthYear
- All variables above should be private.

### Constructor:
The main constructor should take in all values and assign them to their respective private class variables

### Methods: 

Create public getters and setters for all fields. e.g.
- getFirstName
- getLastName
- setFirstName
- setLastName
- etc.

Create a public getter method called getBirthday, which will return a String composed of their birthday in month/day/year format. For example, if birthMonth=3, birthday=22, birthYear=2000, it should return the String "3/22/2000"

### Note
- It does not make sense for a Person's birthMonth to be set to a value less than 1 or greater than 12. Thus, add code to the setBirthMonth method so that if an invalid value is given, then the field is not modified.
- Similarly, for setBirthDay, if the value given is less than 1 or greater than 31, then do not modify the field. Note that this would still allow invalid dates to be set, but determining all valid dates is a tricky problem (think leap years)!
- This is a good example of where encapsulation may be useful. If the birthMonth and birthDay fields were declared as private, there
would be no way to stop another class from creating a Person with a birthday that makes no sense in reality. Thereby, you may catch a programming error (or a user input error) before it becomes a problem.
